    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tenerina is my favorite dessert, one of the many Italian specialties and originally from the city of Ferrara. It is basically a chocolate cake, not fluffy at all but instead it is thin and thick and <em>very</em> chocolatey.<p>

    <p>It is very good with a sprinkling of powdered sugar and with some whipped cream or a side of mascarpone cream.</p>
    
    <p>Here I am about to disclose to you my own secret recipe, I hope you'll like it!<p>

    <h3>Ingredients (in random order)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium-sized eggs</li>
        <li>200 grams of dark chocolate</li>
        <li>150 grams of butter (plus some for the baking tray)</li>
        <li>180 grams of vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>2 level tablespoons of flour (plus some for the baking tray)</li>
        <li>A tiny pinch of baking powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the butter and the chocolate in a saucepan and let them melt, after breaking them in large pieces to ease a uniform melting. Pay attention to not let the butter boil for any reason, it will ruin the whole cake. No idea why but I've learned it the hard way!</li>
        <li>Separate the egg yolks from the whites.</li>
        <li>Take the whites and whip it until they are stiff, then put aside.</li>
        <li>Take a bowl and stir the yolks with the sugar (a little elbow grease will be rewarded), then add flour and baking powder.</li>
        <li>Now you can add the buttery chocolate and, last but not least, the wipped whites, praying for them not to collapse completely.</li>
        <li>Put all in a big buttered and floured baking tray (about 26x33 cm) and bake for 24-25 minute at 180Â°C in static oven.</li>
        <li>Let it cool down and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
